My Name is **Stefan Ilic** and I am a software engineer based in Vienna, Austria. I am mainly a .NET backend developer 

### This blog

I really like markdown, and strangely enough, I like the way [Medium](https://medium.com/) looks (but I don't like Medium) so I chose this [Mediumish](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll) template.

### Contact me

You can send me an email at [stefan@ilic.dev](mailto:stefan@ilic.dev) or slide into my Twitter DMs but let's be honest, why would you ever do that.
