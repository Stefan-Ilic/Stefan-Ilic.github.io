My Name is **Stefan Ilic** and I am a software engineer based in Vienna, Austria. As you can see very cleary from the looks of this blog, I am **not** a front end type of guy, In fact, I am mainly a .NET backend developer. 

### This blog

I really like markdown, ruby not so much. So I chose this [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) template from Github since it doesn't require me to handle any gems or anything.

### Contact me

You can write me an email at [stefan.ilic.vie@gmail.com](mailto:stefan.ilic.vie@gmail.com) or slide into my Twitter DMs but let's be honest, why would you ever do that.
